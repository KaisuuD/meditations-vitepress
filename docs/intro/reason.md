# Why I Made This Website?

2023对我来说是有些许沉重的一年，这是我人生中第一次面对死亡这一课题：我在大学期间结识并维系友情近10年的挚友，自杀了。

这件事令我无比悲痛，虽然阴霾逐步退却，可那无法回避的既定现实也让我不得不对"死亡"乃至"人生的价值"发起思考。

《沉思录》是我在疗愈创伤中阅读的一本书。尽管我很早就知道这本书，但恰当的阅读时机让它对我而言拥有了更深刻的意义。

它能唤起原本就存在于我们每个人身上的力量 - 或许是心灵，善良，美德；或许是接纳自己的命运而带来的从容。

它是一本有用的好书，我希望每个人都能试着去阅读它。

所以我建立了这个网站，秉承开源精神与公共领域贡献原则，希望‘沉思录’能够得到传播。

## 其他原因

- 我一直想建立一个网站，也对编程抱有兴趣。在经历了一番资料查询后，我找到了VitePress，它是一款能快速满足我需求的SSG。本站将是我第一个制作的网站，也是我对VitePress和github的初步练习。

- 掌握英语是我的一个目标，阅读英文文章可以积累词汇量，所以我会再次阅读《沉思录》的英文版本。并且我打算借助词典与AI工具完成对这本书的中文翻译 — 在我所读到的《沉思录》的中文版本中，译者会使用一些高级的中文词汇，这或许会阻断一部分并未受到系统化教育的人们对这本书的阅读欲望。我希望通过我的翻译能够让每个中文母语者甚至中文学习者都读到这本书最通俗易懂的版本。

- 就像我在上文中提到的，自由自在地创作是或许是刻印在我命运中的一件事。现在，我再次意识到了它并乐于接纳它，所以我会在网站的中文版本中附录一些我对这本书的思考。

# Why I Made This Website?

2023 proved to be a weighty year for me, marking my first encounter with the topic of Death. A cherished friend, with whom I had cultivated a bond spanning almost a decade from our university days, took their own life. 

This heartbreaking event left me in deep sorrow. While the shadows gradually receded, the inescapable reality compelled me to reflect on "Death" and, more broadly, the "Value of Life". 

***Meditations*** was a book I turned to in the process of healing from this trauma. Although I had known about this book for a long time, the timing of this reading bestowed upon it a more profound significance. 

It possesses the ability to awaken power inherent within each of us — perhaps the strength of the mind, kindness, or virtue; perhaps the composure derived from accepting one's destiny. 

It stands as an invaluable masterpiece, and I highly recommend everyone to give it a read. Much like the description of the website as 'A Personal Inspiration Site', I aspire for this book to illuminate and inspire you. 

So I established this website, adhering to the principles of open-source spirit and public domain contributions, hoping that ***Meditations*** could be disseminated widely. 

## Other Reasons

- I've always wanted to create a website and have an interest in programming. After some research, I found VitePress, a Static Site Generator (SSG) that could quickly meet my needs. This site will be the first one I create, serving as my initial practice with VitePress and GitHub.

- Mastering English is one of my goals, and reading English articles helps me build my vocabulary. Therefore, I will read the English version of ***Meditations***. Additionally, I plan to use dictionaries and AI tools to accomplish the Chinese translation of this book. In the Chinese versions I've come across, the translators tend to use some advanced Chinese vocabulary, which might deter someone who have not received systematic education from reading the book. I hope my translation can provide the most accessible version for every Chinese native speaker and Chinese learner.

- As mentioned earlier, free and easy creation might be something imprinted in my destiny. Now, I realize it again and embrace it. Therefore, I will append some of my reflections on this book in the Chinese version of this website.
